\section{Introduction}

In this project, we implemented the ancient Chinese board game Go. The main achievements of the project are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Do a case study of the connected component algorithm.
    \item Set up a productive developer workflow combining Leon verification and Scala unit testing.
    \item Verified several properties of our implementation of the board game Go.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design}

\subsection{Game}

Because Leon doesn't support side effects, the first task of the project is to
make a purely functional design. To achieve this goal, we modeled the game as a
finite list of board states as follows:

\lstinputlisting{code/board.scala}

The type \emph{Cell} represents the color of the stone, it's defined as follows:

\lstinputlisting{code/cell.scala}

The type \emph{Step} represents an action that can be taken by the player, it's defined as follows:

\lstinputlisting{code/step.scala}

The type \emph{PlayerType} represents the two sides of a game, it's defined as follows:

\lstinputlisting{code/player-type.scala}

\subsection{Rules}

Each game has rules that should be observed by the players. Inside the world of Go, there're several popular rules, such as Chinese rule, Japanese rule, etc. In order to decouple rules from the game, we implemented the rules in \emph{RuleEngine}, so that it's possible to implement different sets of rules. The object \emph{RuleEngine} is defined as follows:

\lstinputlisting{code/rule-engine.scala}

There could be several types of move errors, which are defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
  abstract class MoveError

  case object KoError extends MoveError
  case object OutsideOfBoardError extends MoveError
  case object AlreadyOccupiedError extends MoveError
  case object SuicideError extends MoveError
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Player}

There are several types of players in the game, such as computer players, human players, etc. We impose that all kinds of player should implement following interface:

\lstinputlisting{code/player.scala}

When the method \emph{move} is called, the player should decide an action based on the given state of the game. Currently we implemented three types of players in the game:

\begin{itemize}
\item HumanPlayer: make a move from user input in the console
\item ComputerPlayer: make a move based on MinMax algorithm
\item RandomPlayer: make a random move
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Driver}

The game is driven by the driver. An example driver is as follows:

\lstinputlisting{code/driver.scala}

With the driver defined as above, it's easy to run a game like following:

\lstinputlisting{code/run.scala}

\section{Verification}

The design of the game ensures that no player can violate the game rule. We only need to verify that the game rule implementation is correct. We are able to verify following properties of the game:

\begin{itemize}
\item Can’t place cell outside the board
\item Can’t place on occupied cell
\item The board size remains unchanged
\end{itemize}

In the verification of game rules, the most difficult part is the \emph{depth first search} of connected component. The verification result of the DFS algorithm is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item All points are connected  --- FAIL
\item The component is maximal  --- FAIL
\item The root is in the component --- SUCCESS
\item All points are of same color --- FAIL
\item All points are on the board --- SUCCESS
\end{itemize}

The difficulty lies in that the relation \emph{connected} is transitive, but Leon knows nothing about that. The DFS algorithm looks like follows:

\lstinputlisting{code/cc.scala}


\section{Lessons Learned}

During the project, we learned some lessons about Leon and verification in general.

First, we find that \emph{class state invariants} are helpful, which is a nice feature to have in Leon.  For example, in the class Point, we’d like very instance of Point to satisfy the pre-condtion. Unfortunately, we have to duplicate the requirement in almost every usage of Point.

\lstinputlisting{code/class-invariant.scala}

Class state invariant not only avoids duplicate code, but also enables programmers to think about verification at a higher level of abstraction, and it’s more natural with the object-oriented mind-set.

Second, we find that Leon can be improved to reduce surprises for developers. Following are two examples.

\lstinputlisting{code/surprise.scala}
